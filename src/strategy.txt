Posting to stories MATTERS

Resharing posts helps!

Commenting is huge!

Add Hashtags after you write the caption preceded by “. . . . .” (one dot per line) so that they get truncated.
    - Makes post seem less spammy
    - Increases likeability of post 
    - Another option is to add the hashtags as first comment following post 

Research shows NINE, is the optimum number of hashtags per post

Don't use the most popular hashtags, better optimize to specific audiences
